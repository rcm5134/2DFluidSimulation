# 2DFluidSimulation
2D Fluid Simulation using C++. I've implemented advection, viscocity, and buoyancy into the simulation as well as some other features such as a heat map view and white hot/black hot views. The rest of the code was given by CSE 472 Computer Graphics at Michigan State University. This simulation is based on the paper Stable Fluids by Jos Stam

# How to use
There are two ways to access this program. Either open the 2DStableFluids.exe file in the Release folder, or open the 2DStableFluids.sln file using Visual Studio with MFC application support installed.
